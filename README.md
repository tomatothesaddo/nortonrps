# nortonrps
a rock paper scissors game created by the fictional Norton Studios, a subsidiary of the equally ficional Norton Softproducts ltd.

might update this if I feel like it, and report issues if you get any but I think it's too basic to really have any bugs.

if you can find all the references and easter eggs I snuck in there, message me and I'll add any feature of your choice (within reason, I'm not going to port it to rust
or turn it into an open world action rpg or whatever lol)
